// 1. Event listener for the search bar (not sure if this would happen if the user enters or if there is ANY input yk)

// 2. Google's bookmarks are stored in a tree, gotta traverse through all bookmarks

// 3. While traversing through bookmarks, check if the... name?? is included in the search bar (idk about keywords yet)

// 4. If the name is in the search bar, add it to the results text somehow idk

// 5. Somehow allow this process to occur continuously in case the user searches diff things (rn assuming that this happens automatically)
