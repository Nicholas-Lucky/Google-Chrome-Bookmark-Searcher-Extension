# Steps to Download This Extension:
1. Above the extension files, click on "<> Code"
2. In the dropdown menu, click on "Download ZIP"
   Note: Be cautious; to my knowledge, none of the extension files should be malicious, however it's always good to be cautious
3. After the ZIP file has been downloaded, upzip the ZIP file. there should be a folder called "Google-Chrome-Bookmark-Searcher-Extension-main"
4. The extension files should be in this ^^ folder

# Steps to Use This Extension in Google:
1. Download and get the "Google-Chrome-Bookmark-Searcher-Extension-main" folder (as explained in "Steps to Download This Extension")
2. In Google Chrome, click on the three dots that appear on the top right of the window (under the close "X" button, to the right of the account profile picture)
3. In the dropdown menu, click on "Extensions", and then click on "Manage Extensions"
4. In the Extensions window, I think there is a switch on the top-right called "Developer mode". turn "Developer mode" on if it isn't already. This allows for users to upload their own extensions from their device to use on Google Chrome

6. Select the "Google-Chrome-Bookmark-Searcher-Extension-main" folder, and click "Select Folder"
