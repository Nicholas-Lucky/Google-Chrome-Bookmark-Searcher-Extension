# Bookmark Searcher Extension (Google Chrome)
An extension to look up saved bookmarks (coded for Google Chrome)
Started: December 27th, 2024

# Overview
This extension allows users to search for specific bookmarks they have saved on their Google Chrome browser. The extension will take in a user input, and will retrieve bookmarks that contain the user's input in their titles (not their URLs). There are also five themes to choose from (via button icons on the bottom-right of the extension window), which change the background and color palette of the extension.

# Steps to Download This Extension:
1. Above the extension files, click on "<> Code"
2. In the dropdown menu, click on "Download ZIP"
   Note: Be cautious; to my knowledge, none of the extension files should be malicious, however it's always good to be cautious
3. After the ZIP file has been downloaded, upzip the ZIP file. there should be a folder called "Google-Chrome-Bookmark-Searcher-Extension-main"
4. The extension files should be in this ^^ folder

# Steps to Use This Extension in Google:
1. Download and get the "Google-Chrome-Bookmark-Searcher-Extension-main" folder (as explained in "Steps to Download This Extension")
2. In Google Chrome, click on the three dots that appear on the top right of the window (under the close "X" button, to the right of the account profile picture)
3. In the dropdown menu, click on "Extensions", and then click on "Manage Extensions"
4. In the Extensions window, I think there is a switch on the top-right called "Developer mode". turn "Developer mode" on if it isn't already. This allows for users to upload their own extensions from their device to use on Google Chrome
5. On the top-left of the Extensions window, under the "Extensions" heading, click on "Load unpacked"
6. Select the "Google-Chrome-Bookmark-Searcher-Extension-main" folder, and click "Select Folder"
7. The extension should be added to Google!
   Note: By default, the extension is called "Bookmark Searcher", and its current version is 1.0
